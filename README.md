# GifTastic
1. Created an array of strings, each one related to a car brand. 
2. the topics, or car brands in this array and create buttons in the HTML.
3. Used a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.
4. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
5. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
6. Under every gif, the rating is being displayed(PG, G, so on).
7. All this data is provided by the GIPHY API.
8. Added a form to the page which takes the value from a user input box and adds it into topics arra. Then made a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
